            <p class="lead">Pictures Speak a Thousand Words... What are they saying to you?</p>
            <p>The other day I open an email from a top employment site, proclaiming that a top IT company is accelerating hiring for tech workers (Article Resource 3). I felt this was exciting news for the industry being that I am currently obtaining my degree in that field. So I open the article, to see where I might fit in, to my dismay the first thing I see, is a picture of happy office workers, all of them under forty. They say that pictures speak a thousand words, this spoke volumes to me stating that "you may apply if you are a tech worker, but you can't be over forty". Pictures like this do send a underlying message of what the company is really looking for. Does it mean that they won't hire anyone not within their age group, no but it does send that message. </p>
            <p><h4>AARP is a strong advocate</h4>AARP has been fighting this same fight for years. For example, They have a national effort to have employers proclaim that they will hire people no matter their age and recognize that experienced people are valuable, by signing an AARP Employer Pledge, (Article Resource 2). This is a wonderful effort and it should continue, but here is the problem out of all the companies in the United States only 290 have signed this, Thank You. To make this more intimate, in my home State of Indiana only three have signed it and only one of them is an actual business the other two are advocacy groups. It seems to me that a majority of the companies in this country don't want to commit to such a pledge, because in the eyes of companies they are hiring a liability and the easiest thing for them to do is ignore the fact that older people apply to their open positions. </p>
            <p>If this is an unfounded accusation then please prove this author wrong and sign the pledge, better yet hire a tech worker that is 40, 50, 60 or yes, even 70 years old. This may help to reduce the crying need for tech workers in the United States and not having to look elsewhere for them. The reason that so many older workers are still working or having to go back to work is the fact that retirement age has increased and a lot of older Americans simply don't have the funds to retire and sustain themselves, so working is their only option. These people are eager to help out and provide expertise that is only seen by experience, instead a growing number of them are greeted with "your over qualified", "You don't have enough experience", (This is one my wife heard from a Major seller of Toys, when in fact that she had spent her entire life in the field, she was interviewed by a 30 something.) there are probably a thousand others that have been heard, if you can think of any post them in the comments.</p>
            <p><h4>Ageism</h4>It happens all the time to workers but it seems to more pronounced in the technical fields. Especially when you have people like Mark Zuckerberg spouting off that he wants to "stress the importance of Young and Technical", " Younger people are just smarter" (Article Resource 4),in his 2007 school event. </p>
