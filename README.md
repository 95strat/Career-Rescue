# Career-Rescue
Capstone Project for SNHU
Career Rescue is a website solution which attempts to unite Employees(Applicants) 
that are considered as being one of 12 categories protected by the EEOC.
It will attempt to put employer and Applicant in close communication to dicuss any potential issues openly and honestly,
so going in everyone is aware of any issues ahead of time. 
Secondary goal is to allieviate law suites being filed with the EEOC. The home page gives the staggering numbers for 2016.
Discrimination is a complicated subject so only three areas were put in for the sake of time.
Currently there are some issues with the site.
  1) You can Sign up using the sign up page, but it is intermittanly storing information in the database. Fixed 3-12-17 dbk
  2) because of reason Number 1 no login was created. 
  3) The Job board exists, but it is a third party job board because of reason Number 1
The SQL SERVER database does exist and operates normally if used directly, the website uses entityframework and LINQ to access the database
on a Database first system.
As noted above the database issue was resolved, but not sure if there is time to complete all of the above items. 
Currently the requirements for the project have been met, but they are not exactly the way it was planned.
These issues can be resolved at a latter date. But if enough time is left an attempt to resolve the issue before 3/19 will be made.
